- Blacklisted tabs should be muted by default to avoid them to sound for a small amount of time before being muted when playing a sound
- Convert storage to storage sync so the extension data is stored between different pcs 
- Add audio priority: If several tabs sound at the same time, the active one mutes all the others
- If a page starts playing sound and there was a previous one that was playing, we could ask to avoid new tab to interfere with previous one
